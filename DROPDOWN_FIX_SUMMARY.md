# Dropdown Fix - Summary

## Problem
Dropdowns (Select components) were not showing their options when clicked in the deployed application at leads.workboosterai.com.

## Root Cause
The dropdown content had insufficient z-index (z-50) and was using `overflow-hidden`, which prevented the dropdown options from being visible above other page elements.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Select Component (`src/components/ui/select.tsx`)
- **Increased z-index**: Changed from `z-50` to `z-[9999]` to ensure dropdown appears above all other elements
- **Fixed overflow**: Changed from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible` to allow dropdown content to be displayed
- **Added hover states**: Added `hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground` to SelectItem for better UX

### 2. Enhanced CSS (`src/index.css`)
Added explicit styling rules for Radix UI portals and select components:
```css
/* Ensure Radix UI portals are properly rendered */
[data-radix-popper-content-wrapper] {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}

/* Ensure select content is visible */
[role="listbox"] {
  background-color: hsl(var(--popover)) !important;
  color: hsl(var(--popover-foreground)) !important;
}

/* Ensure select items are visible */
[role="option"] {
  background-color: transparent;
}

[role="option"]:hover,
[role="option"][data-highlighted] {
  background-color: hsl(var(--accent)) !important;
  color: hsl(var(--accent-foreground)) !important;
}
```

## Changes Made
- ✅ Modified `src/components/ui/select.tsx`
- ✅ Modified `src/index.css`
- ✅ Built production bundle (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Committed changes to Git
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub repository

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)
SSH into your Linux server and run:

```bash
cd /root/wb_lead
git pull origin main
npm run build
# Optional: restart PM2 if you want to be safe
pm2 restart all
```

### Alternative: Manual Upload
If you prefer, you can upload the pre-built `dist` folder from your local machine:

```bash
# From your local Windows machine (PowerShell)
scp -r dist root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/wb_lead/
```

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Visit https://leads.workboosterai.com
2. Navigate to the Sourcing page or any page with dropdowns
3. Click on dropdowns like:
   - "Generated By"
   - "Stage Update"
   - "Status"
   - Industry dropdown in the Add/Edit Lead form
4. Verify that all dropdown options are now visible and selectable
5. Test selecting different options to ensure they work correctly

## Affected Components
All Select dropdowns throughout the application:
- Lead form dropdowns (Industry, Source From, Generated By, Stage, Status)
- Table column dropdowns (DE assigned to, Stage Update, Status)
- Filter dropdowns (All Stages, All Sources)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Dropdowns in the lead form (Add Lead modal)
- [ ] Dropdowns in the table (inline editing)
- [ ] Filter dropdowns at the top of the page
- [ ] Dropdowns work in all pages (Sourcing, Initial Connect, etc.)
- [ ] Hover states work correctly
- [ ] Selected values are displayed properly

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
```bash
cd /root/wb_lead
git checkout HEAD~1
npm run build
pm2 restart all
```
