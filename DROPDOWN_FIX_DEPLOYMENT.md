# Quick Deployment Guide - Dropdown Fix

## Changes Made
Fixed the dropdown visibility issue by:
1. Increased z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9999]` in the Select component
2. Changed overflow from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible` 
3. Added hover states to dropdown items
4. Added explicit CSS rules for Radix UI portals and select content

## Files Changed
- `src/components/ui/select.tsx` - Updated z-index and overflow
- `src/index.css` - Added portal and dropdown styling rules

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using Git (Recommended)
```bash
# On your local machine
git add .
git commit -m "Fix dropdown visibility issue"
git push origin main

# On your Linux server
cd /root/wb_lead
git pull origin main
npm run build
pm2 restart all
```

### Option 2: Manual File Upload
If you're not using Git, upload these files to your server:

1. **Upload the entire `dist` folder** (already built locally) to `/root/wb_lead/dist` on your server

2. **Or rebuild on server:**
```bash
# SSH into your server
cd /root/wb_lead

# Pull latest code or upload changed files manually
# Then rebuild
npm run build

# Restart PM2 (if backend was affected)
pm2 restart all
```

### Option 3: Direct File Copy (if you have SSH access)
```bash
# From your local machine (PowerShell)
# Replace YOUR_SERVER_IP with your actual server IP
scp -r dist root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/wb_lead/
```

## Verification
After deployment:
1. Visit https://leads.workboosterai.com
2. Click on any dropdown (Generated By, Stage, Status, etc.)
3. Verify that the dropdown options are now visible
4. Test selecting different options

## Rollback (if needed)
If something goes wrong:
```bash
cd /root/wb_lead
git checkout HEAD~1  # Go back to previous commit
npm run build
pm2 restart all
```

## Notes
- The build is already complete in your local `dist` folder
- You can simply copy the `dist` folder to your server
- No backend changes were made, so the server restart is optional
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R) if you don't see changes immediately
